```

### Technology Stack and Design Decisions

**Frontend Framework**:
- **Selection**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Rationale**: Industry-leading React framework with built-in SSG, excellent SEO, and performance optimization features
- **Alternatives**: Astro (better performance but less flexible), Gatsby (outdated), vanilla React (lacks SSR/SSG)

**Styling & UI**:
- **Selection**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Rationale**: Utility-first CSS for rapid development, shadcn/ui provides accessible components with modern design system
- **Alternatives**: Styled Components (runtime overhead), CSS Modules (less flexible), pure CSS (maintenance burden)

**Content Management**:
- **Selection**: File-based content with Markdown + frontmatter
- **Rationale**: Developer-friendly, version-controlled, no external dependencies, excellent performance
- **Alternatives**: Headless CMS like Sanity (added complexity), JSON files (less readable), traditional CMS (overkill)

**Key Design Decisions**:

**Decision 1: Static Site Generation (SSG) Architecture**
- **Context**: Need maximum performance and SEO while minimizing hosting costs
- **Alternatives**: Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- **Selected Approach**: Full static generation with build-time content processing
- **Rationale**: Portfolio content changes infrequently, static sites achieve best performance and can be hosted on CDN
- **Trade-offs**: Gain superior performance and hosting flexibility vs. sacrifice real-time content updates

**Decision 2: Component-First Architecture with Design System**
- **Context**: Need maintainable, consistent UI across all pages with room for customization
- **Alternatives**: Utility-only classes, pre-built theme, custom CSS architecture
- **Selected Approach**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS and custom design tokens
- **Rationale**: Provides accessibility, consistency, and customizability while maintaining performance
- **Trade-offs**: Gain component reusability and design consistency vs. some initial setup complexity

**Decision 3: File-Based Content Management**
- **Context**: Content updates should be trackable, reviewable, and not require external services
- **Alternatives**: Headless CMS (Sanity, Contentful), Database-driven, Hardcoded content
- **Selected Approach**: Markdown files with structured frontmatter in Git repository
- **Rationale**: Version control integration, no external dependencies, excellent developer experience
- **Trade-offs**: Gain simplicity and control vs. sacrifice non-technical user content editing

## Data Models

### Content Domain Model

**Core Entities**:

- **Project**: Represents individual work samples with metadata, descriptions, and media assets
- **Skill Category**: Groups related technical and soft skills with optional proficiency indicators  
- **About Content**: Personal information, professional summary, and career timeline
- **Contact Information**: Communication preferences and social media links

**Business Rules & Invariants**:

- Projects must have unique slugs for URL generation
- Featured projects limited to maximum of 6 for performance
- All images must include alt text for accessibility
- Contact form submissions require valid email format

### Physical Data Model

**File System Structure**:

```
content/
├── projects/
│   ├── project-1.md
│   ├── project-2.md
│   └── images/
│       ├── project-1/
│       └── project-2/
├── about.md
├── skills.md
└── contact.md

public/
├── images/
│   ├── hero/
│   ├── projects/
│   └── icons/
└── assets/
    ├── resume.pdf
    └── documents/
```

**Markdown Frontmatter Schema**:

```yaml
# Project Frontmatter
---
title: "Project Name"
description: "Brief project description"
technologies: ["React", "TypeScript", "Tailwind"]
liveUrl: "https://example.com"
repoUrl: "https://github.com/username/repo"
featured: true
publishedAt: "2025-01-15"
status: "completed"
images:
  - src: "/images/projects/project-1/hero.jpg"
    alt: "Project screenshot"
    priority: true
---
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

**Content Validation**:

- Schema validation for all markdown frontmatter
- Image asset verification and optimization
- Link validation for external URLs
- Accessibility audit for alt text completeness

**Performance Optimization**:

- Image optimization with next/image automatic formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Content preloading for critical above-the-fold resources
- Bundle analysis and code splitting optimization

## Error Handling

### Error Strategy

**Graceful Degradation**: Portfolio sites must remain functional even when individual components fail. Implement fallback content, skeleton loading states, and progressive enhancement patterns.

**Build-Time Validation**: Comprehensive content validation during static generation prevents runtime errors and ensures content quality.

**Client-Side Resilience**: Robust error boundaries and retry mechanisms for dynamic features like contact forms and analytics.

### Error Categories and Responses

**Content Errors**: Missing project data → display placeholder card with "Content coming soon"; Invalid image paths → fallback to default project image; Malformed frontmatter → skip invalid entries with build warning

**Network Errors**: Contact form submission failure → show retry option with offline indicator; External link verification → graceful degradation with warning icon; Analytics tracking failure → silent failure without user impact

**Performance Errors**: Slow image loading → progressive loading with blur placeholders; JavaScript bundle failure → ensure core content remains accessible; Third-party service outage → disable enhanced features temporarily

### Monitoring

**Build-Time Monitoring**: Content validation reports, broken link detection, image optimization metrics
**Runtime Monitoring**: Core Web Vitals tracking, form submission success rates, user journey completion rates
**Error Tracking**: Client-side error boundary reports, failed form submissions, performance threshold breaches

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Content parsing and validation functions
- Utility functions for date formatting and text processing  
- Component prop validation and error states
- Image optimization and responsive behavior
- Accessibility helpers and screen reader support

### Integration Tests

- Markdown content to component rendering pipeline
- Contact form submission workflow with validation
- Navigation state management across route changes
- SEO metadata generation from content files
- Image loading and optimization across different screen sizes

### E2E Tests

- Complete user journeys from landing to project detail views
- Contact form submission with success/error scenarios
- Mobile responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Page loading performance and Core Web Vitals
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Performance Testing

- Lighthouse CI integration for automated performance audits
- Bundle size monitoring and optimization verification
- Image loading performance across network conditions
- Time to first meaningful paint optimization validation

## Security Considerations

### Content Security Policy

- Strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
- Allowlist for trusted external resources (fonts, analytics)
- Image source restrictions to prevent hotlinking abuse
- Form submission CSRF protection

### Privacy & Compliance

- GDPR-compliant analytics configuration with user consent
- Privacy-focused analytics options (Plausible, Fathom alternatives)
- Contact form data handling with proper retention policies
- Clear privacy policy for data collection practices

### Static Site Security

- Build environment security for content pipeline
- Asset optimization without exposing sensitive build information
- Secure hosting configuration with HTTPS enforcement
- Regular dependency updates and security scanning

## Performance & Scalability

### Target Metrics

- **Lighthouse Performance Score**: >95
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP <1.2s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1
- **Time to Interactive**: <2s on 3G networks
- **Bundle Size**: <150KB gzipped initial load

### Optimization Strategies

**Static Generation Optimizations**:
- Pre-generated HTML for all routes eliminates server response time
- Automatic code splitting reduces initial bundle size
- Image optimization with next/image for responsive delivery
- Font optimization with next/font for reduced layout shift

**Caching Strategy**:
- CDN edge caching for static assets with long cache headers
- Service worker implementation for offline content access
- Browser caching optimization for repeat visitors
- Dynamic import caching for route-based code splitting

**Content Delivery Optimization**:
- Critical CSS inlining for above-the-fold content
- Resource hints (preload, prefetch) for anticipated navigation
- Progressive image loading with blur placeholders
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold content and images
