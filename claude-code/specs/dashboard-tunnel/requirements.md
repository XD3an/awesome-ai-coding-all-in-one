# Requirements: Dashboard Tunnel Feature

## Overview

Enable secure, temporary sharing of the Claude Code Spec Workflow dashboard with external stakeholders (managers, clients, team members) who don't have access to the development environment.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product's core value proposition of "Project Visibility" by extending dashboard access beyond the local development environment, enabling stakeholders to monitor progress in real-time without technical setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Secure Tunnel Creation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a secure tunnel to my local dashboard, so that I can share real-time progress with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a developer runs `claude-spec-dashboard --tunnel` THEN the system SHALL create a secure tunnel to the local dashboard
2. WHEN the tunnel is created THEN the system SHALL display a shareable HTTPS URL
3. IF the tunnel creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
4. WHEN the tunnel is active THEN the system SHALL display the tunnel status in the dashboard UI

### Requirement 2: Read-Only Access
**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared dashboards to be read-only, so that external viewers cannot modify any project data.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN accessing the dashboard via tunnel URL THEN viewers SHALL only have read access
2. IF a viewer attempts any write operation THEN the system SHALL block the action
3. WHEN viewing via tunnel THEN the UI SHALL clearly indicate read-only mode
4. WHEN in read-only mode THEN all interactive elements SHALL be disabled or hidden

### Requirement 3: Tunnel Management
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage tunnel lifecycle, so that I can control when and how my dashboard is shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a tunnel is active THEN the developer SHALL be able to stop it via CLI or dashboard UI
2. WHEN stopping a tunnel THEN all active connections SHALL be gracefully terminated
3. IF the developer's machine goes offline THEN the tunnel SHALL automatically close
4. WHEN a tunnel expires THEN viewers SHALL see a friendly expiration message

### Requirement 4: Authentication Options
**User Story:** As a developer, I want optional authentication for tunnel access, so that I can control who views my dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating a tunnel THEN the developer SHALL be able to set an optional access password
2. IF a password is set THEN viewers SHALL be prompted to enter it before accessing the dashboard
3. WHEN using password protection THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and notify the developer

### Requirement 5: Tunnel Provider Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use reliable tunnel providers, so that sharing is stable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN initializing tunnel features THEN the system SHALL support multiple providers (Cloudflare, ngrok)
2. IF a provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically try alternates
3. WHEN using a provider THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and quotas
4. WHEN a provider requires authentication THEN the system SHALL guide setup clearly

### Requirement 6: Usage Analytics
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see tunnel usage metrics, so that I know who accessed my dashboard and when.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a tunnel is active THEN the system SHALL track basic access metrics
2. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the developer SHALL see visitor count and access times
3. IF configured THEN the system SHALL send notifications for new viewers
4. WHEN storing metrics THEN the system SHALL respect privacy and data retention limits

## Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

1. **Network Issues**: Handle intermittent connectivity, firewall restrictions
2. **Provider Limits**: Gracefully handle rate limits, quota exhaustion
3. **Security Concerns**: Prevent tunnel URL guessing, implement request filtering
4. **Performance**: Ensure dashboard remains responsive under tunnel traffic
5. **Compatibility**: Support various browser versions for external viewers

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: Tunnel latency should add < 200ms to dashboard response times
2. **Security**: All tunnel traffic must be encrypted (HTTPS/WSS)
3. **Usability**: Tunnel creation should require single command with clear output
4. **Reliability**: 99% uptime for active tunnels during development sessions
5. **Scalability**: Support at least 10 concurrent viewers per tunnel
